# Governing Equations 

# Solid mechanics 
# 1. deformed shape subject to mechanical, thermal, electrical loading
# 2. forces required for a particular shape change
# 3. stiffness of a structure or component
# 4. internal forces (stress) in a component
# 5. critical forces for failure by structural instability (buckling)
# 6. natural frequencies of vibration
